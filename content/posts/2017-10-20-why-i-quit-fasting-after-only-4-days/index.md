The prospect of lasting more than 2-3 hours between ingestions of food just a few months ago would have been impossible. Laughable, even. How times have changed.

I'd wake up **hungry**, be **hungry** after eating a meal, go to bed **hungry** (perhaps _hangry_) and snack continuously during waking hours, 7 days a week. I was **hungry** all the time.

With the introduction of the ketogenic [diet] lifestyle in to my life, all that has changed. Gradually as I have become adapted to eating a 70%+ fat diet, my food cravings have vapourised and my body's insatiable demand for more calories has lessened almost to the point of non-existence.

This week, I achieved what I once thought was impossible... I went 4 days without food. However, this was short of my original goal of fasting for 5 days.

**I quit. Early. Here is the reason why.**

### You should know

I am not the average keto'er. At the time of starting the fast, I weighed in (on [my extremely inaccurate Salter fat analyser scales](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Salter-Analyser-Bathroom-Measure-Percentage/dp/B003X3A3EY/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1508460252&sr=8-4&keywords=body+fat+scales)) at **11st 10lbs** (164lbs, or 74.38kg) and **18.8%** body fat.

Whilst I have struggled with weight gain in the past, I got this under control long before I started keto. I do not (to the best of my knowledge) have any metabolic damage and **I do not have type 2 diabetes**.

### Fasting goals

I have been gradually getting used to fasting over a period of a few months and the more I do it, the better I feel during. After becoming keto-adapted, where my body switches from a sugar burner (energy derived from carbohydrates) to a fat burner (energy derived from existing body fat or from fat consumed), hunger has gradually trailed off.

Fasting started with moving to 2 meals a day, typically breakfast and dinner, to 1 meal a day, just dinner, to 48 hours between meals.

The goal was to **stretch from 48 hours to 5 days**, limiting intake to just 3 simple things; English Breakfast Tea (with 20ml of cows milk) a maximum of twice per day, sugar free cordial (as little as possible) and salt.

Fasting began with the end of dinner of 15th October 2017 at around 6pm, and finished on 19th October 2017, with a [Keto Hot Chocolate](/recipes/keto-hot-chocolate) followed by a variation of the [fat head pizza](/recipes/fat-head-pizza).

### Preparation

I did not do anything special to prepare for the fast. As mentioned, I have been building towards it over time.

The main step was to ensure that I was already in ketosis before starting the fast. Whilst not impossible to fast whilst not in ketosis _you'll need max willpower to do so as you'll essentially be starving yourself_. I ate as few carbs as possible for several days before hand to get my [blood ketone level up to a respectable 1.6mmol/L](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaMdkW8nmVU/?taken-by=ketogenic_family).

Before the fast on the left, after the fast on the right. I am looking considerably leaner. I consider myself to have been between 12-14% body fat before starting.

### First 48 hours

The initial 24 hours was just a normal day, as I routinely eat 1 meal a day this helped a lot. I just kept myself busy in the evening and went to bed at a resonable time. I did not consume any salt and I just had 1 cup of breakfast tea (with soy milk, as my wife prefers that) and several glasses of water with sugar free fruit juice. **Easy**.

The second 24 hours was mostly the same. I felt good and didn't struggle much. I consumed about 2 teaspoons (tsps) of pink himalayan salt, which I got a good boost from about an hour after consumption. I did experience very (very) mild headaches but nothing to write home about.

Generally, **I felt well and energetic**.

### Hours 48-96

On day 3, hours 48-72, **I decided not to consume any salt**. The reason was simply that I did not feel the need to eat any salt (I felt well) and I was not going to the gym on that day so I felt that this step was not necessary. **This was a mistake**.

The effects of low electrolyte balance hit me immediately when I woke on the morning of the fourth day. **I felt low on energy**, and generally my body and muscles (especially, interestingly, my hips) felt stiff and weak.

I went to the gym, and tried to power through this, thinking that once I got my heart rate up I would be fine. This was a fail and I ended up leaving the gym early.

As soon as I got to work, I ate 1 teaspoon of salt, and after about 15 minutes I felt back to my usual self. Lesson learnt; **consume salt daily, and _do not skip this step_**.

### Why I decided to quit

During the course of the 4 days, I lost (again according to my inaccurate scales) about 6lbs (2.72kg) and about 3% body fat. I would guestimate that about half of the weight loss was water and half body fat.

I train at the gym regularly, and I am trying to get leaner and stronger over time (and some muscle gain would be nice).

**I quit the fast because I have lost size**. My biceps have reduced in size considerably (I wish I had measured before hand, but I can tell very clearly when I flex).

It is widely accepted in the ketogenic community that [fasting does preserve muscle mass](https://ketogenic.com/performance/will-lose-muscle-ketogenic-diet/) and I guess this is probably true.

I suspect that I still have the same muscle density as before, but have reduced visually in size due to my body holding less water. I can tell easily that I am holding less water because I can drink several glasses of water in a short space of time and not need to go to the bathroom. Also, when I do go to the bathroom, my urine is very concentrated and a deep yellow color.

This is an obvious sign of **dehydration**.

I quit because I was worried about losing muscle mass. I regularly consume large amounts of protein whilst on the ketogenic diet, up to 2g per 1kg of body mass, [which is considerably highly that the recommended amount](https://www.dietdoctor.com/how-much-protein-can-you-eat-in-ketosis) for maintaining muscle mass. This is because I am not trying to maintain muscle mass, I am **trying to increase muscle mass**.

I can consume high amounts of protein and remain in ketosis.

### How I will fast going forward

I will make some changes next time I fast. I will fast for **shorter periods of time**, 24-48 hours, as I was feeling at my best during this time. I will consume at least **1 teaspoon of salt per day**. I will drink **more water**, to stave off dehydration.

### Results at the end

And by the way, just before consuming my first meal for 4 days, I measured my blood glucose levels and blood ketone levels.

My ketone levels rose from 1.6mmol/L to 4.8mmol/L, whilst my blood glucose remained at a very healthy 4.1mmol/L, meaning I was in no any danger of developing [ketoacidosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx), a condition that develops from a combination of high blood glucose _and_ high ketone levels.
